m=[100,200]
for i in m:
    print("GLA")
    m.append(i)


#  Sure, let me break down the code step-by-step:
# We initialize a list m with two elements, 100 and 200: m=[100,200]
# We start a for loop that iterates over the elements of the list m using the variable i. 
# Since m has two elements, the loop will execute twice.
# Inside the loop, we print the string "GLA" using the print statement: print("GLA")
# We call the append method on the list m, which adds the current element (100 or 200) to the end of the list: m.append(i)
# After the loop has executed twice (once for each initial element in m), the loop will start again with the updated list m=[100,200,100,200]. This time, the loop will have four elements to iterate over, and it will keep going forever, since we keep appending elements to the list m within the loop.
# As a result, the loop will keep printing "GLA" and adding elements to the list m forever, resulting in an infinite loop.
